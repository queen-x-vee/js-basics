6. Statically typed programming languages require that the type of a variable be explicitly declared before it can be used in the program. The type checking is done at compile-time, before the program is executed. Once the type of a variable is declared, it cannot be changed. Dynamically typed programming languages, on the other hand, do not require explicit type declarations. The type of a variable is inferred at runtime based on the value assigned to it. The type checking is done at runtime, as the program is executed. The type of a variable can be changed during runtime. 
Examples of statically typed languages include Java, C, C++, Swift, and Go.
Examples of dynamically typed languages include Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, and Lua.
7. undefined is a value that is assigned to a variable that has not been initialized, or to a function parameter that has not been passed a value. null, on the other hand, represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is typically used to indicate that a variable should have no value
